Tonight we watched the season finale of _Star Trek: Picard_ — don't worry, I'm not going to spoil anything.

What I will say, is that it had lots of very appropriate nostalgia, including use of Irving Berlin's _Blue Skies_ which fans will recall from a previous movie.

That's not really what is important. What is important is the reminder that even in the toughest, darkest of times, we can still choose to be good to one another.

And that brings me to my work day. In the midst of so much fear and heartbreak, a number of my coworkers took the time to share some of their heart and soul with their colleagues through a community hour. From their own homes, people shared music, comedy, bread and lots of heart.

It was a nice enough afternoon that I propped up my iPad on my porch and sat outside, enjoying the sun, the sky and my amazing colleagues.

That, along with the wisdom of Jean-Luc Picard and I definitely feel like I can handle whatever the next day brings my way.
