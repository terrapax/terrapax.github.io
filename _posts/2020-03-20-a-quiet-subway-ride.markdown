For the first time in a week, I took the subway. I had my monthly allergy shots.

There are the particles that I know are in the air and are harmful to my lungs. And to make that harm less, I made it more likely that I would encounter other particles that are harmful to my lungs.

Those aren't great options. But that's the current moment.

I am incredibly grateful for the staff at my allergy and asthma clinic, those who keep the MTA running and everyone else who has to leave their home right now to make it possible for me to leave the house for an hour and a half. And I'm thankful to everyone who stayed home so that as few people were on the subway as possible.

It was amazing to me how much that little trip made my day feel a bit more normal, even though it was in the middle of the morning and not at a time when I am typically on the subway. But it was familiar, even with wearing gloves and my allergy shot clinic having modified procedures.

Plus, it was warm, and that was nice.

And then there were 3 hours of Zoom calls — the NEW normal.
