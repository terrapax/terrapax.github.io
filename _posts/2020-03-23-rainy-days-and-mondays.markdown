It was a very rainy day. Good thing I didn't have any outside plans! HA! Remember outside plans!

Honestly, I don't mind rainy days most of the time, and I'd rather one on a day when the rain doesn't really prevent me from doing something I would rather be doing.

But today felt like a rainy day inside and out. It was a bit of a struggle to do, well, most things. I often look forward to Mondays and the joy (yes, for me it is the joy) of seeing my coworkers and connecting with everyone.

But there's currently not much that makes connecting with people on a Monday different than connecting with people on a Sunday, and, well, that's a bit weird to me.

So you know what I did: I stopped. For a bit of time in the afternoon I just paused and took a break. I did dishes and listened to music. I let my brain think about other things for a little while.

After this rainy day, I took a look out the window at the tree outside our apartment and went outside for another breath of fresh air.

Rainy days and Mondays don't have to get you down, but it's okay if they do.
