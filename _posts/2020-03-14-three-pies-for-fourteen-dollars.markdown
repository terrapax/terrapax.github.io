It is Pi Day.

This is a good memory day for me. One of the first dates with my partner was on Pi day. We went to the botanical gardens in Omaha and then and endless adventure to find a place that was serving pie. We ended up at a German Bakery — that did not have pie — but by that point we were ready for whatever sweet things they had. Then we put together little mini-legos we bought at the gardens before checking in with friends who had St. Patrick's Day misadventures planned.

Today certainly involved less moving around, though I did enjoy sitting in some of the little sidewalk parks scattered throughout Park Slope as I made my way towards Four & Twenty Blackbirds which was serving 3 slices of pie for 14 dollars.

_Yes, I know AP Style says you should write out "three" but "three.14" looks silly._
